   *«Intelligence is the ability to avoid doing work, yet getting the work done.»*

   -- Linus Torvalds

The following is a set of guidelines for installing and using the ATF assets for action automation in Unity.

***************
Getting started
***************

1. Installing asset

Short version is just drag-and-drop the .unitypackage file into opened Unity Editor if you have one and it's done.

Or you can hit *Add* in `asset store page <https://assetstore.unity.com/>`_ of the asset.
If you have some troubles installing this asset, i suggest you to see this `official guide <https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ImportingAssets.html>`_ on importing things in Unity.

2. Preparing scene

Drag-and-drop into your scene *Initializer* prefab in ATF/Prefabs directory of your assets.
Remember, if you destroy this game object the asset functionality won't work.

3. Preparing Unity Editor

All of the management windows are now fully functional.
To add Integrator Window press: ATF/Integrator.
To add Recorder Window press: ATF/Recorder.
To add Storage Window press: ATF/Storage.

Starting from scratch
*********************

Just use *AtfInput* instead of *Input* class and recorder will work perfectly.

Here is an example of Mover class that will rotate around YZ axis given game object when you hit space key:

.. code-block:: csharp
   :linenos:

   using UnityEngine;

   namespace ATF.Scripts.Example
   {
       public class Mover : MonoBehaviour
       {
           private const float SPEED = 100f;

           private void Update()
           {
               if (AtfInput.GetKey(KeyCode.Space))
               {
                   transform.Rotate(new Vector3(0, 1, 1), Time.deltaTime * SPEED);
               }
           }
       }
   }

*****************
Integrator Window
*****************

The Integrator Window is used to integrate ATF functionality easily into complete code base.

.. image:: ./images/integrator.*
    :align: center

If you starting from existing project you may want to use one of the options:

Automatic integration
*********************

Just hit *Integrate All* button and it's done.
The algorith of integration is simple. The integrator selects all of .cs files in your project
then in all files it performs regexp search of *Input* class usage turning it in *AtfInput* class usage.

Integration in specific files
*********************************

To integrate in some specific files you can enter to *.cs file path* path from Assets directory to your script with *Input* class usage.

Clicking *Add path* and *Remove path* buttons you can prepare your own set of scripts for integration.

Using *Save paths* and *Load paths* buttons allow you to save and load set of scripts for reintegration if it is needed.

To clear all saved paths you can just remove all paths and hit *Save paths*.
After paths list preparation you have two options:

* *Integrate and replace* button: integrate with replacing contents of chosen files.
* *Integrate* button: Integrate without replacing contents and with creating dublicate file with ATF suffix in file name.

***************
Recorder Window
***************

The Recorder Window is pretty basic to use. The window features three sections: **Recorder state**, **Recording control**, **Replay control**.

.. image:: ./images/recorder.*
    :align: center

**Recorder state** is uninteractable section, it just show you the state of the recording.

**Recording control** is interactable section. Here is how to use it:

1. The recorder is a state machine and the name of the record is used as cursor. To set the record name just type to *Name of the recording* field specific name and hit enter. You will see that *Current recording name* has changed.

2. Hit record button *Start* and the window will change like that:

.. image:: ./images/recorder_recording.*
    :align: center

The *Stop* and *Pause* buttons are to stop or pause recording. If you click *Pause* the window will change:

.. image:: ./images/recorder_paused.*
    :align: center

To continue recording just click *Continue* button.

**Replay control** is also interactable section. Here is how to use it:

1. Now you can play previously recorded actions. Simply type the name of the record a hit enter.
2. Hit replay button *Start* and see how window has changed:

.. image:: ./images/recorder_playing.*
    :align: center

The *Stop* and *Pause* buttons are to stop or pause replay. If you click *Pause* the window will change:

.. image:: ./images/recorder_playing_paused.*
    :align: center

To continue replay just click *Continue* button.

.. note:: If you try to replay a non-existent record it'll do nothing. Also there is no mechanism to reverse replay yet. Please consider this using the asset.

**************
Storage Window
**************

The Storage Window is to provide persistence management for records you made.

It features two required sections and two optional sections: **Current records**,
**Saved records** and **Current commands and actions queues**, **Saved commands and actions queues**.

Optional means you can hide those sections by checking and unchecking the *Display current details* or *Display saved details* checkboxes.

.. image:: ./images/storage.*
    :align: center

**Current records** is section where records that just loaded to RAM are illustrated and they are ready to be recorded again (with erasing previous actions data) and replayed.

**Saved records** is section for records that are saved.

By double-clicking to saved or current record you can see the contents of it in **Current commands and actions queues** section or **Saved commands and actions queues** section. There is the example of such contents:

.. image:: ./images/storageContains.*
    :align: center

Here is how to use the window:

1. The Storage Window is also a state machine. The cursor is *Current recording name* in this window. To set up this cursor you have to just click on any record name in **Current records** or **Saved records** sections.
2. The buttons *Save*, *Load* and *Scrap* are to save to **Saved records** section, load to **Current records** section and scrap record from saved records.
3. To set up cursor in Recorder Window just right-click to any record name in **Current records** section.

.. note:: You cannot set up Recorder Window cursor from Storage Window if record is not loaded to **Current records** section.
